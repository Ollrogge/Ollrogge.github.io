title:  "HITCON ctf 2023 quals"

Last weekend I played the qualification for the HITCON ctf as part of [Maltese Prison Escapees](https://ctftime.org/team/220769). We got 8th and by that unfortunately missed the final by 1 place :(.

Same as last year, the ctf had once again a fullchain pwn challenge to offer. This time it was chroot jailbreak -> kernel -> QEMU escape. This post is a writeup of the [QEMU escape](#maria-sec) (Wall Maria) and the [kernel challenge](#rose-sec) (Wall Rose).
