Hi ! I am Nils. I am security engineer at Security Research Labs, focusing on code assurance audits in blockchain and other security-sensitive systems.

In my free time I love to play CTF's with [ARESx](https://x.com/ARESxCTF) and [Friendly Maltese Citizens](https://x.com/malta_ctf).

I also enjoy experimenting with embedded systems and low-level hardware, and recently designed my first PCB :)
